Project: University Admission Procedure

Stage 6/7: Extensive training

Description

Some of the departments proposed an improvement to the algorithm. They need 
more than one exam results for each applicant. For example, the Physics 
Department needs both math and physics exams, while the Mathematics Department 
is satisfied with the math exam only. Let's implement this request to make our 
departments happy (the applicants on the other hand...)


File Name: applicant_list_6.txt

Objectives

At this stage, your program should:

1. Read an N integer from the input. This integer represents the maximum 
   number of students for each department.
2. Read the file named applicants.txt once again. The file has the same 
   structure as in the previous stage.
3. Consider the following exam results for departments: physics and math for 
   the Physics department, chemistry for the Chemistry department, math for 
   the Mathematics department, computer science and math for the Engineering 
   Department, chemistry and physics for the Biotech department.
4. As in the previous stage, the exams are listed in the following order for 
   each applicant: physics, chemistry, math, computer science.
5. For the departments that need several exams, calculate the mean score and 
   use it to rank the applicants (use floating-point numbers with at least one 
   decimal). Otherwise, use the result for a single exam.
6. Keep the rest of the steps the same as in the previous stage (once again, 
   there should be no more than N accepted applicants for each department; use 
   the same principles for sorting).
7. Instead of printing the results (you may do it if you want), output the 
   admission lists to files. Create a file for each department, name it 
   %department_name%.txt, for example, physics.txt. Write the names of the 
   students accepted to the department and their mean finals score to the 
   corresponding file (one student per line).


Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. 
Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1: 

Below is an example of the input file

The test score order is: physics, chemistry, math, computer science 

Applicable test scores:
Physics = physics + math (1 + 3)
Chemistry = chemistry (2)
Math = math (3)
Engineering = math + computer science (3 + 4)
Biotech = physics and chemistry (1 + 2)
